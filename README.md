# ML-Learning üß†

Welcome to my **ML-Learning** repository\! This is where I document my exciting journey into the world of Machine Learning, showcasing practical applications and model development. This repository currently features two distinct projects: an **Olympic Medal Prediction Model** üèÖ and a **Calories Burnt Prediction Model** üî•.

## 1\. Olympic Medal Prediction Model ü•áü•àü•â

This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast the number of Olympic medals a country is likely to win, based on historical performance and other relevant factors.

### üéØ Project Overview

  * **Objective:** To predict the number of medals a country will win in the Olympic Games using historical data.
  * **Data Source:** The project utilizes a `teams.csv` dataset containing historical Olympic data for various countries, including their `team` (country code), `country` name, `year`, `age` of athletes, number of `athletes`, and `prev_medals` (medals from the previous Olympics).
  * **Methodology:**
      * **Data Loading & Initial Exploration:** The `teams.csv` dataset is loaded using pandas. Initial exploration includes viewing the first few rows and examining correlations, particularly with the `medals` column.
      * **Data Cleaning:** Missing values in the dataset (specifically in `prev_medals`) are handled by dropping rows with `NaN` values to ensure data integrity for modeling.
      * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
          * Distributions of key numerical features like `Age` and `Medals` are visualized using histograms (`.plot.hist()`) to understand their patterns.
          * Relationships between `athletes` and `medals`, and `age` and `medals` are visualized using `seaborn.lmplot` to identify potential linear relationships and trends.
      * **Feature Engineering:** The `prev_medals` column is directly used as a predictor, which is a form of feature engineering by leveraging past performance.
      * **Model Selection:** A `LinearRegression` model from `sklearn.linear_model` is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability in predicting numerical outcomes.
      * **Training and Testing:**
          * The data is split into training and testing sets based on the `year` column: data before 2012 is used for training, and data from 2012 onwards is used for testing.
          * The model is trained using `athletes` and `prev_medals` as predictors and `medals` as the target variable.
      * **Prediction and Evaluation:**
          * Predictions are made on the test set.
          * Negative predictions are set to 0, and all predictions are rounded to the nearest integer as medal counts must be non-negative and whole numbers.
          * The model's performance is evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
          * Error ratios (absolute error divided by actual medals) are calculated per team to understand prediction accuracy relative to the number of medals won.
  * **Key Learnings:**
      * `athletes` and `prev_medals` show strong positive correlations with `medals`.
      * The model provides a baseline for predicting medal counts, with an average absolute error of approximately 3.3 medals.
      * Further improvements could involve adding more features (e.g., GDP, population, host country advantage), using more complex models, or refining feature engineering.

## 2\. Calories Burnt Prediction Model üî•üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the number of calories burnt during exercise, based on various user and activity parameters.

### üéØ Project Overview

  * **Objective:** To build a model that accurately predicts calories burnt during physical activity.
  * **Data Sources:** The project uses two datasets:
      * `calories.csv`: Contains `User_ID` and `Calories` burnt.
      * `exercise.csv`: Contains `User_ID`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `Duration`, `Heart_Rate`, and `Body_Temp`.
  * **Methodology:**
      * **Data Loading & Merging:** Both `calories.csv` and `exercise.csv` datasets are loaded and then merged based on `User_ID` to create a comprehensive `calories_data` DataFrame.
      * **Initial Data Inspection:** The project checks the shape, info, and null values of the combined dataset to understand its structure and identify any missing data.
      * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
          * Distribution of `Gender`, `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, and `Duration` are visualized using `seaborn.countplot` and `seaborn.displot` to understand the data's characteristics.
          * A heatmap is generated to visualize the correlation matrix of numerical features, helping identify relationships between variables and the target (`Calories`).
      * **Data Preprocessing:** The `Gender` column (categorical) is converted into numerical format (male: 0, female: 1) for model compatibility.
      * **Feature and Target Separation:** The `User_ID` and `Calories` columns are dropped from the feature set (`X`), leaving `Gender`, `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `Duration`, `Heart_Rate`, and `Body_Temp` as predictors. `Calories` is set as the target variable (`Y`).
      * **Data Splitting:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test) using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.
      * **Model Selection & Training:** An `XGBRegressor` model from the `xgboost` library is chosen, and trained on the preprocessed training data.
      * **Prediction and Evaluation:**
          * The trained model makes predictions on the test set.
          * The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is calculated to assess the model's accuracy, showing how close the predictions are to the actual calorie values.
  * **Key Learnings:**
      * `Duration`, `Heart_Rate`, and `Body_Temp` are likely strong predictors of calories burnt, as suggested by correlation analysis.
      * The `XGBRegressor` provides a highly accurate model for calorie prediction, with a very low Mean Absolute Error of approximately 1.48.
      * The project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation for a regression task.

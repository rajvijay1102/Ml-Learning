# Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains two machine learning projects developed as part of my learning journey in machine learning through the PML (Python Machine Learning) project series.

Project 1: Olympic Medals Prediction
Description
This project aims to predict the number of medals each country will win in the Olympics using a Linear Regression model. The model is trained on historical Olympic data and various country-specific features to estimate medal counts.

Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Linear regression model implementation

Model evaluation using appropriate metrics

Visualization of predictions vs actual medal counts

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

How to Run
Load the dataset (historical Olympic data).

Preprocess the data and select features.

Train the linear regression model.

Evaluate the model and visualize results.
